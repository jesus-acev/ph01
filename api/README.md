# Introduction

This project structures was created using git flow, Therefore, after cloning the project you have to execute the below
command in your local workstation.

    git flow init

## Important issue:

- For your local test, you have to use an embedded database H2, that it was configured in the file:

        src/test/resources/application-test.properties

- For all your commits, you must to use the template included in the project. First, you should configure your favorite
  IDE for this task. In the example I use "vim", but you can use others like emacs, nano, code etc.

        git config --global core.editor vim
